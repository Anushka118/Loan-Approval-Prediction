# Loan-Approval-Prediction

In this problem, we need to predict whether the loan will be approved or not, given a set of conditions. 
The datasets are downloaded from Kaggle. The train dataset is used to check which algorithm gives the best accuracy and and that algorithm is used to predict the results for test data.
The data is first analysed to check the dependency of status of the Loan on different parameters. The data is first pre-processed and the 'Null' values are replaced in the most suitable manner. Then, the data is divided into train and test data. Four different algorithms are applied on the data and the most suitable algorithm is selected. 
The classifiers applied are Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours, and Logistic Regression.
